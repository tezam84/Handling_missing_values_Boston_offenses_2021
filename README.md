# Handling_missing_values_Boston_offenses_2021

In the real world, a dataset with no missing values doesn't exist...So in this notebook, we explore different ways of dealing with it.

The dataset is dealing with more than 71,000 observations with 17 columns
The variables are : INCIDENT_NUMBER, OFFENSE_CODE, OFFENSE_CODE_GROUP, OFFENSE_DESCRIPTION, DISTRICT, REPORTING_AREA, SHOOTING,            OCCURRED_ON_DATE, YEAR, MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK, HOUR, UCR_PART, STREET, Lat, Long, Location 

We are using the following libraries: pandas, seaborn, numpy and missingno.
Through bar plot, dendogram and matrix plot we can have a clear insight about the missing values and how remove useless variables
